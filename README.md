## Features
The Inspirational Homepage has several key features, including:

### Task Management
Users can create and manage their tasks by adding them to a to-do list. The tasks can be marked as done, removed, and are displayed with random colors and contrast with white font. The completed tasks are shown with 80% opacity.

### Authentication with Firebase
The app also provides authentication functionality, allowing users to create accounts that store task data in a Firestore database. The application has three forms: sign-in, registration, and password reset using a user's email.

### Weather Information
The app uses a user's coordinates to fetch local weather data from openweathermap.org. Users must allow location sharing for this feature to work. If user denied share their location they can choose city from the list.

### Daily Quotes
You get a random daily inspirational quote from api-ninjas.com. One query takes series of 10 quotes from the API, and when the user reaches the last quote, the app gets new series of quotes.

### Background Images
Users can toggle through a series of 15 background images from Unsplash. If there is no internet connection or the API limit is reached, the app uses three local images.
